This file contains short descriptions of some AnnoTool features.
Note that the features listed here are by far not complete and subject to changes.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>>>>  Major-Features  <<<<
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


<<  Multiple Shape Support  >>
------------------------------
AnnoTool supports the following shapes for annotating image regions...

 * 'Single Point' for marking image points, e.g. viewpoints.
 * 'Rectangle' for marking rectangular image regions.
 * 'Ellipse' for marking elliptic image regions.
 * 'Polygon' for marking all kinds of advanced shaped image regions.

All these shapes can be used for marking regions on the same image and they are stored
together in the same file.
All shapes can be drawn onto the image with the special annotation shape tools, one tool
for every shape for easy regions marking and editing.


<<  Annotation Classes & Attributes  >>
---------------------------------------
AnnoTool supports multiple annotation classes and attributes per annotation.
You can assign multiple classes to each annotation. A class can have predefined
attributes whose values can be set individually for each annotation.
You can assign custom attributes without association to any class. So you have total
freedom of how to organize your annotation data.


<<  Rich Annotation Visualisation  >>
-------------------------------------
AnnoTool visualizes all image annotaions on a zoomable and panable canvas which you can
easily interact with. You can use the various tools to create new annotation shapes
and edit existing ones in real time seeing what you do.


<<  Native XML File Format  >>
------------------------------
AnnoTool's native file format for storing project and annotation data is a
specialized xml format. So the stored data can be easily be read by humans or imported
by other tools and programmes.


<<  Extensible Im- & Export-System  >>
--------------------------------------
AnnoTool has a built-in system for im- and exporting annotation data. There are a number
of default plugins. These are the following...

 * 'IDL-Importer' for importing default IDL annotation files including rectangles and
   associated scores.
 * 'IDL-Exporter' for exporting all compatible annotation data into an default IDL
   data file.


<<  Extensible Image- & Video-Loader-System  >>
-----------------------------------------------
AnnoTool has a built-in system for loading various image and video file formats. All
image types can be viewed and annotated whith a suitable image loader plugin.

<<  Annotation Hierarchy  >>
----------------------------
AnnoTool supports the possibility to organize image annotations in a tree-like
hierarchy. Annotations can be inserted into the hierarchy at creation time or
they can be moved within the hierarchy later on.


<<  Easy Class & Attribute Assignment  >>
-----------------------------------------
AnnoTool supports a menu based way of assigning classes and attributes. That is an easy
and fast way of perfomring such assigning actions. Recently used classes, attributes
and values are hold in memory such that they can be assigned even faster.


<<  Multi-Annotation Manipulation  >>
-------------------------------------
In future versions there will be support for manipulating (e.g. moving, sizing) multiple
annotations and shapes at once.


<<  Copy & Paste  >>
--------------------
In future versions there will be support for copying and pasting annotations along with
all data.
