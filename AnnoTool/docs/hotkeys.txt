---------------------------
Defined in a text file whose lines obey the following format:

  <modifier 0>+<modifier 1>+...+<modifier n-1>+<key><TAB><label>

Empty lines, as well as lines beginning with # are ignored.

Example:

  # vim:ts=30

  F1	First label
  F2	Second label
  Shift+F3	Third label
  Control+F5	Fifth label
  Shift+Control+F12	Twelfth label

Use the -l (or --labels) flag to load the file.

For the names of the keys and the modifiers, consult:

  http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qt.html#Key-enum
  http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qt.html#KeyboardModifier-enum

Remove the "Key_" prefix and the "Modifier" suffix.
